## Advice on using the api

To run the API, you will need to use docker. Also, to use the post and put endpoints, you must use a JSON request body.

## Example of user registration üë®‚Äçüíª

To register a user, use the POST method:
```code
/api/auth/registration
```
An example of a request:
```json
{
  "email": "kate@example.com",
  "password": "123456",
  "repeatPassword": "123456",
  "firstName": "Kate",
  "lastName": "Johnson",
  "shippingAddress": "125 Main St, City, Country"
}
```

### **Note:**
When you create a user using the post method, he is automatically assigned the USER role. 
To change the role to ADMIN, execute a sql query after registration:
```code
INSERT INTO users_roles (user_id, role_id) values(NEW_USER_ID, 2);
```
In response, you will receive information about the registered user with the assigned ID:

## Example of user login üë®‚Äçüíª

For user login, use the POST method:
```code
/api/auth/login
```
An example of a request:
```json
{
  "email": "marry@example.com",
  "password": "123456"
}
```
In response, you will receive a unique access token that you can use for further requests:
